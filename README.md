Hey, I'm Mickey

I’ve been working in IT for over 10 years and hold a
bachelor’s degree in information technology.

I’ve participated in many hackathons and won all the in-person ones.

I’m also a member of Solana Superteam Poland and regularly
give presentations at Solana events across the country.

Currently, I’m focused on blockchain development using Rust.
Over the past 7 months, I’ve been working on trading bots,
indexers, and data analysis.
