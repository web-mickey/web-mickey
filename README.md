Hey, I'm Mickey

I've been in the IT industry for over a decade and hold a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Over the years, I’ve participated in numerous hackathons—taking first place at every in-person event I've attended.

I'm an active member of the Solana Superteam Poland and frequently speak at Solana meetups and events across the country. I'm also a participant in the Solana Turbin3 Q2 2025 Builders Program..

Right now, my main focus is blockchain development using Rust. For the past 7 months, I’ve been building trading bots, on-chain indexers, and working on blockchain data analysis.
